# Java GUI Tic-Tac-Toe

### Created by Cameron Lau, Ryan Kwong, and Namra Joshi.

## App Description

Everyone knows what Tic-Tac-Toe is, but this application is a complete Java GUI version of it! It was created using the Model-View-Controller architecutre. 

To make things slightly different, we allowed the users to select a custom background color and font before playing the game. Moreover, we added an UNDO functionality where each user gets 3 UNDOs per game. 

## Installation

No installation required! All that needs to be done is cloning the repository!

## Usage

1. Run the TicTacToeTest.java file under ./Code
2. Select a background color
3. Select a font
4. Play the game!
